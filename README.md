You may ask, *"What on Earth is this?"*. That is a very good question. And it's got a very, very clear answer. I've got no idea.

You might find a use for it; I am using it for presenting `.mp4` video like it is a PowerPoint Presentation (kinda). I needed to be able to embed it in a website - and so this hacky mess was born.

 - Compile the program using `tsc`.
 - Host the .js files (I am using VSCode Live Server).
 - Open the `index.html` file.
 - Bang!
